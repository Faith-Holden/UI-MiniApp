UI MiniApp is a miniature app I created to showcase creation of a user signup UI. 
The 'new' view showcases a user input form, and the 'index' view shows existing/newly created users.

A few things of note are:
* The form handles input errors originating in failed model validations (e.g. the email is invalid)
* After validation of data, user input is stored in a sqlite database, and can be viewed at the "index" tab.
* UI theme is based on a simplified version of material.io's material study "Basil" 

**I also deployed UI MiniApp as a heroku web app, and it can be viewed by clicking this link.**
